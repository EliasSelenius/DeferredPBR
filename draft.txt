to research:
    - normal mapping
    - IBL
    - tesselation shaders 
    - order independent transparancy
    - transform feedback
    - point sprites
    - compute shaders
    - SSAO
    - MSAA / FXAA
    - sdfgi




add "Render targets" 
    api that render to screen or off-screen buffers can now be agnostic


upcomming todos:
    - transform gizmo 
    - object highlight
    - delete menue
        - 'x' as delete key will open different delete options
            - delete parent only
            - delete whole object
    - canvas rect border radius

    - unlit materials    

    - glsl bind UBO pragma or somthn


new shaderprogram system:
    - preprocessor
        - includes (with #line and possibly #error when file not found)
        - vertex/fragment/geometry in same file
    - auto UBO bindings
    - cache uniform locations
    - hot-reload


pirate game idea:
    level 1:
        basic bouyancy physics
    level 2:
        water waves
    level 3:

    





blocky spacegame idea:
    level 1:
        build ship out of blocks
    level 2:
        bake all blocks into one mesh
    level 3:
        place thrusters on ship, and have them thrust



game design principles:
    - premature optimalization/abstraction
    - kiss (keep it simple stupid)
    - feature creep



what to use Source Generators for:
    - Nums
    - void update() instead of protected override void update()
    - scripting language transpiler
    - generating a parser (Pgen)
    - reflection (inside Prefab) begone
    - auto material class
