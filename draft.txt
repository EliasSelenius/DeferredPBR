    - IBL
    - tesselation shaders 
    - order independent transparancy
    - transform feedback
    - compute shaders
    - SSAO



pirate game idea:
    level 1:
        
    level 2:
    level 3:

    





blocky spacegame idea:
    level 1:
        build ship out of blocks
    level 2:
        bake all blocks into one mesh
    level 3:
        place thrusters on ship, and have them thrust



game design principles:
    - premature optimalization/abstraction
    - kiss (keep it simple stupid)
    - feature creep



what to use Source Generators for:
    - Nums
    - void update() instead of protected override void update()
    - scripting language transpiler
    - generating a parser (Pgen)
    - reflection (inside Prefab) begone
